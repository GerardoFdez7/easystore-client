    "introTitle": "Introduction",
    "introP1": "At EasyStore, our mission is to boost commerce for all microenterprises and SMEs in Guatemala. To achieve this, we collect and use information about you and others who interact with our platform.",
    "introP2": "This Privacy Policy will help you better understand how we collect, use and share your personal information. If we change our privacy practices, we may update this policy. If any changes are significant, we will notify you (for example, through the EasyStore control panel or by email).",

    "valuesTitle": "Our Values",
    "valuesP1": "Trust is the foundation of the EasyStore platform. We believe that doing the right thing with your information is fundamental. Three main values guide us in the development of our products and services in Guatemala:",
    "valuesP2": "• Your information belongs to you: we carefully analyze what kind of information we need to provide our services and strive to limit collection to what is strictly necessary. When information is no longer required, we delete or anonymize it. In developing and improving EasyStore, our engineers work hand in hand with our privacy and security teams to ensure that privacy is always a priority. Our guiding principle is that your information belongs to you and our goal is to use it only for your benefit.\n• We protect your information from third parties: If a third party requests your personal information, we will refuse to share it unless you give us your permission or we are legally obligated to do so under Guatemalan law. When we are legally required to share your personal information, we will notify you in advance, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.\n• We help merchants and partners comply with their privacy obligations: Many of the merchants and partners using EasyStore do not have a dedicated privacy team. For us, it is vital to help them meet their privacy obligations in the Guatemalan context. That's why we design our products and services to be user-friendly and privacy-friendly. We also provide clear documentation on privacy issues and respond to questions we receive regarding privacy.",

    "whyTitle": "Why do we process your information?",
    "whyP1": "Generally, we process your information when necessary to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example, to process your subscription payments to use the EasyStore platform), or when we or someone we work with needs to use your personal information for a business-related reason (for example, to provide you with a service). These \"legitimate interests\" include:\n• Risk and fraud prevention.\n• Answering questions or providing other types of support.\n• Helping merchants find and use apps through our app store.\n• Providing and improving our products and services.\n• Provide reporting and analysis.\n• Test additional features or services.\n• Assist with marketing, advertising or other communications.\n  \n\n\nWe only process personal information for these \"legitimate interests\" after considering the potential risks to your privacy and balancing any risks with measures such as providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, giving you control over your personal information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send it to, how long we keep it, or the technical measures we use to protect it.\n\nWe may also process your personal information if you have given us your consent. In particular, where we cannot rely on any other lawful basis for processing, where you ask us to transfer information to a third party, where we receive your data from a third party and already have your consent, or where we are required by law to seek your consent (including in the context of some of our sales and marketing activities). At any time, you have the right to revoke your consent by modifying your communication choices, unsubscribing from our communications or contacting us.",

    "whereTitle": "Where we send your information",
    "whereP1": "EasyStore is a company operating in Guatemala, but in order to provide our services to you effectively, we may work with service providers and process data with them. This may involve your personal information being sent outside of Guatemala, including to the United States. This data may be subject to the laws of the countries to which we send it. We take steps to protect your information when we send it to other countries by ensuring that contractual and technical safeguards are in place.",

    "howLongTitle": "How long do we keep your information?",
    "howLongP1": "We will retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collect it. In determining the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of your personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes by other means, as well as applicable legal requirements in Guatemala (tax regulations requiring record retention). We will also retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our policies.\n\nIf you stop using our services or delete your account, we will delete your information or store it in an aggregated and anonymous form, provided that there is no legal obligation to retain it for a specific period.\n\nIf you are a merchant operating a store powered by EasyStore and you close the store, stop paying your subscription fees or we cancel your account, we retain the store information for 1 year before we begin the deletion process.\n\nWhen a customer visits or makes a purchase at a merchant's store that uses EasyStore, we act as a service provider or processor for the merchant. It is the merchant, not EasyStore, who decides how long their customers' information is retained.",

    "protectTitle": "How we protect your information",
    "protectP1": "Our teams work tirelessly to protect your information and ensure the security and integrity of our platform. We implement technical, administrative and physical security measures, including data encryption (SSL/TLS), access controls and regular audits.\n\nHowever, we all know that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. This means that we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.",

    "cookiesTitle": "How we use cookies and other tracking technologies",
    "cookiesP1": "We use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website and in providing our services to keep your session active and improve platform functionality.",

    "contactTitle": "How you can contact us",
    "contactP1": "If you would like to inquire, submit a request or file a complaint about how we process your personal information, please contact the EasyStore support team or send us an email at the address below. If you wish to submit a legally binding request to request another person's personal information (for example, if you have a subpoena or court order), please contact us directly to receive the appropriate guidelines.\n\nIf you are a merchant, partner or visitor to the EasyStore website, and EasyStore has a direct relationship with you, EasyStore is the controller of your personal data.\n\nIf you buy something from a store powered by EasyStore or provide them with your information, the merchant is the data controller of your data, and we act as data processors on their behalf. If you have questions about how a merchant or store processes your personal information, you should contact the merchant directly or visit their privacy policy."
